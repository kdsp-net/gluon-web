Alex and Patrik are the founding partners of Gluon Syndicate, carrying the vision of connecting angel investors with promising pre-seed startups from the CEE region since the early days of their entrepreneurial journey. Both brothers are natural-born entrepreneurs with over 15 years of experience in commercial activities within burgeoning and rapidly growing companies.

Their careers began with the launch of their family-owned pharmacy in the Czech Republic. They later co-founded a full-service marketing agency and played a crucial role in the commercial team of one of the worldâ€™s first private railway operators. As co-founders, they dedicated themselves to scaling smart home technology across Europe, achieving multiple awards with their Slovak-Czech scale-up. They also briefly assisted a top CEE venture capital firm with fundraising.

In addition to their investment activities at Gluon Syndicate, Alex and Patrik advise pre-seed and seed startups from the CEE region on creating scalable commercial and marketing strategies under the brand Disruptive Bros. They also mentor aspiring founders at the University Technology Incubator of the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava.
