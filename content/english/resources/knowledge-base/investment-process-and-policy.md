In our syndicate, investing in startups is strongly tied to 4 pitching events during the year (one per quarter).

At these events, our members gather and - based on the presentation of individual startups - decide whether and how much they want to invest in individual opportunities (and express their decision directly at the event).

Startups must consider that our events are the only moment when investment decisions are made, and they should set their expectations and need for financing accordingly.

In the period before the event, we are sourcing and screening startups, and so we set the conditions with them and prepare all the documentation. In the case of a positive decision at the pitching event, everything is already prepared in advance, so the entire subsequent administrative and legal investment process takes only a few days.

Startups set their own investment goal as an amount between 50-300k, and this amount will serve as the threshold of the entire investment. That is why founders should consider the correct level of the investment goal, so that they can realize their business plan and at the same time do not set their investment threshold prohibitively high. The investment target is also important for setting the terms of the CLA: its tenfold (10x investment target) will serve as the valuation cap when converting to equity (in the following qualified investment round). If the startup founders reach the investment goal directly at the event, it will be possible to continue raising money from our angels up to double the goal, if they are interested.

If the sum of the angels' commitments during the event exceeds the threshold (investment target), the investors form an SPV, which invests in the startup based on the signed CLA. The fact that angels enter the startup under one SPV enables the startup to keep a clean cap table even with the participation of numerous individual investors.

Upon reaching the goal, the opportunity is open for member investors (unless the startup limits this possibility in advance) for a period of a maximum of one week from the pitch event or until reaching double the goal. In the case of reaching double the investment goal, even at the event or in the following days, the opportunity is definitively closed and angels are no longer allowed to invest further.

Startups that fail to raise their investment goal from investors directly at the event do not have the opportunity to continue raising money in the group of our angels in the period after the event, and their investment opportunity is considered unsuccessful.
