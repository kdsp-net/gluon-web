## Convertible Loan Agreement (CLA) Summary

### Parties Involved

The agreement is between the **Investor** (Gluon Syndicate), the **Startup (Target Company)**, and the **Founders**. The Investor will provide funding through a convertible loan, with the option to convert the loan into equity under specific conditions.

### Loan Amount & Purpose

 The **Startup** sets two funding targets: an **initial target** and an **additional second target**. The second target serves as an **investment cap**, meaning it defines the maximum amount the startup is willing to raise and cannot exceed **twice the initial target amount**.
   
The CLA becomes effective if the startup raises commitments equal to or greater than the **initial target amount** from the members of the angel syndicate.

If the startup fails to meet the initial target, the CLA becomes **void**, and no investment occurs.

If the total commitments exceed the **initial target**, the startup will receive an investment equal to the **total amount of commitments raised**, up to the second target.

### Interest & Repayment

The loan carries a **simple interest rate of 0.01% per year**.

The loan will **convert into equity** upon a conversion event (explained below) and is not repaid in cash.

### Conversion Events

The loan converts into equity under specific events, including:
- A **significant investment** from a third party.
- A **change of control** in the company.
- The **final maturity date** of **three years from the investment** without any other conversion event. In the event of maturity, the conversion will happen at a **valuation equal to half of the valuation cap**.
 
### Valuation Cap & Discount

The **valuation cap** for the conversion is calculated as **10x the amount raised at the event** where Gluon Syndicate provides funding.

If the startup raises a **qualified round within one year** of receiving the loan from Gluon, the **conversion discount will be 20%**. If no such round is raised within a year, the discount remains at **30%** off the company’s valuation at the next qualified investment round.

### Conditions for Loan Drawdown

Before the loan is disbursed, certain conditions must be met, including:
-  The startup must raise commitments equal to or greater than the **initial target**.

### Supervisory Board
    
A **Supervisory Board** of three members will oversee the company’s governance and key decisions.

The **Founders** appoint **one member**, while the **Investor** (Gluon Syndicate) appoints **two members**, with one serving as the **Chairperson**.

The Supervisory Board makes decisions by a **two-thirds majority** and oversees important matters like:
- Approving the **annual budget** and **business plan**.
- Supervising **key financial transactions**, including investments and loans over certain amounts.
- Hiring or dismissing **key employees**.
- Approving significant changes in company structure, such as mergers or new business ventures.

### Warranties & Representations

 The Founders and the company must ensure that all provided information is truthful and accurate. If any warranties are found to be false, the Investor can claim damages.
 
### Investor Rights

The Investor has the right to **approve or veto major decisions**, such as changes to the company’s structure, major financial commitments, or raising new investments. The Supervisory Board also helps enforce these rights.

### Confidentiality

Both parties must maintain the confidentiality of the terms and sensitive information related to the company.

### Legal & Compliance

The agreement is governed by the laws of Slovakia. Any disputes will be resolved through negotiation or arbitration if necessary.
