# Screening

We screen hundreds of startups every year, pre-selecting 60 of them for pitching events (15 per event).


## Scouting

We actively scout promising startups in CEE through a combination of in-person meetings at startup events and on-line research.


### VC Referrals

We partner with leading CEE VC Funds (Presto, Tensor, Impulse, 0100, Zaka, Crowdberry, etc.) who refer to us leads that are too early for them but whom they consider interesting.


#### Accelerators & Incubators

We have partnered up with accelerators and incubators from the region to get access to their best alumni startups (AceON, StartupYard, InQb, SaaS Garden, etc.)


Network

We have 15+ years of experience in the startup environment. We have built an extensive network of founders, investors, journalists, and other startup enthusiasts, that keep us in the loop.


Inbound

We actively market our syndicate, reach out to media, and build our brand to attract startups.
