#### 4 Events per Year

We host a world-class pitching event every 3 months (starting autumn 2024 in Bratislava).


#### Live Bidding

Every investor bids through a mobile application during the event. The deals are closed right there and then. Everyone knows right away who raised their targets and who needs to work on their pitch a bit more.


#### 15 Startups

We select the best 15 startups from our deal flow and give them the opportunity to showcase themselves - being it on stage, or at their booths.


#### 2 Rounds

The startups are presented in two rounds. In the first round 15 startups pitch their idea to the investors. In the second round, only 6 of the best startups get a chance to showcase their business model and face the hard questions from our guest expert panel.
